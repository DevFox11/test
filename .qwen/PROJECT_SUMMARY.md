# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To implement and enhance the Hidra multitenancy library for Python/FastAPI applications, specifically addressing issues with schema management, tenant table creation, and PostgreSQL compatibility while maintaining developer control over tenant data structures.

## Key Knowledge
- **Hidra Library**: Lightweight multitenancy library supporting SCHEMA_PER_TENANT, DATABASE_PER_TENANT, and ROW_LEVEL strategies
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Schema names cannot contain hyphens (-), only underscores (_) are allowed
- **Table Responsibility**: The `tenants` table in public schema must be defined and created by the developer, not Hidra
- **Model Separation**: Tenant table model should be separate from other models (`app/models/tenant_model.py` vs `app/models/__init__.py`)
- **Schema Management**: Hidra provides SchemaManager for validating tenant names and creating tenant-specific schemas
- **FastAPI Integration**: Uses `initialize_hidra_fastapi()` for minimal setup with automatic tenant middleware
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant gets its own schema with isolation of business data
- **JWT Authentication**: Built-in authentication system with role-based permissions

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created `SchemaManager` class in `hidra/schema_manager.py` for advanced schema management
- [DONE] Implemented tenant name validation and cleaning (hyphens to underscores) for PostgreSQL compatibility
- [DONE] Updated `hidra_test_api` to use new SchemaManager functionality
- [DONE] Separated tenant model definition into `app/models/tenant_model.py` with custom structure
- [DONE] Created endpoints for custom tenant management with developer-defined structure
- [DONE] Added JWT authentication and role-based user management endpoints
- [DONE] Implemented CRUD operations for customers and products per tenant
- [DONE] Updated main application to use `initialize_hidra_fastapi()` with minimal configuration
- [DONE] Added proper error handling and validation for tenant creation processes
- [DONE] Ensured schema manager does not create the tenants table automatically, only interacts with existing table

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Implement SchemaManager with validation and cleaning functionality
- [DONE] Update hidra_test_api to use new Hidra features
- [DONE] Separate tenant model from other models to clarify responsibilities  
- [DONE] Ensure table tenants is defined by developer, not Hidra
- [DONE] Add authentication and authorization endpoints
- [DONE] Implement comprehensive CRUD operations
- [TODO] Document all endpoints and API usage patterns
- [TODO] Create deployment and production configuration guides
- [TODO] Add comprehensive testing for all new functionality
- [TODO] Document security best practices and tenant isolation mechanisms
